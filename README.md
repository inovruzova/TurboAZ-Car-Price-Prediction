This project focuses on predicting car prices using linear regression techniques on a dataset of cars from turbo.az. It includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Visualizations (2D & 3D)
- Linear regression implementation from scratch
- Regression using scikit-learn and the normal equation
- Model evaluation and price prediction on unseen data

The model uses two key features — mileage (Yurush) and model year (Buraxilish ili) — to predict car prices (Qiymet).
