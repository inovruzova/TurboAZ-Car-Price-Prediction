This project focuses on predicting car prices using linear regression techniques on a dataset of Mercedes C-class cars from turbo.az. It includes:

🔍 Data loading and preprocessing
📊 Visualizations (2D & 3D)
🧮 Linear regression implementation from scratch
⚙️ Regression using scikit-learn and the normal equation
📈 Model evaluation and price prediction on unseen data
📑 A summary report with analysis and results

The model uses two key features — mileage (Yurush) and model year (Buraxilish ili) — to predict car prices (Qiymet).
